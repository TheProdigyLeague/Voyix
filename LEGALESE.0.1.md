### 3. Obligations of Controller

The Controller and the Processor shall be separately responsible 🕴️ for conforming with such statutory data protection regulations ⏺️ as are applicable to them in accordance with the protections under the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation 🏤, any applicable SCC obligations, and/or the DPF Frameworks (previously, Privacy Shield). The Controller shall inform the Processor without undue delay and comprehensively about any errors or irregularities related to statutory provisions on the processing of personal data detected during a verification of the results of such processing. The Controller shall, upon instruction or termination or expiration of the Terms, stipulate, within a period of time set by the Processor, the reasonable measures to return data carrier media or to delete stored data. 🐓

### 4. Enquiries by Data Subjects to Controller

Where the Controller, based upon applicable data protection law 🚩, is obliged to provide information to an individual about the collection, processing or use or its personal data, the Processor shall assist the Controller in making this information available, provided that: (i) the Controller has instructed the Processor in writing to do so, and (ii) the Controller reimburses the Processor for the costs arising from this assistance. Where a data subject requests the Processor to correct, delete or block personal data, the Processor shall refer such data subject to the Controller. ℹ️

### 5. Subcontractors 🕴️

The Processor shall be entitled to subcontract the Processor’s obligations defined in the Policies to third parties only with the Controller’s written consent (which shall be affirmed by a Controller’s agreement to the policies). Controller consents to Processor’s subcontracting to Processor’s affiliated companies and third parties 🏛️, as listed in SCHEDULE 2, of Processor’s contractual obligations hereunder. If the Processor intends to instruct subcontractors other than the companies 💻 listed in SCHEDULE 2, the Processor must notify the Controller thereof in writing (email to the email address(es) on record in Processor’s account information for Controller is sufficient) and must give the Controller the possibility to object against the instruction of the subcontractor within 30 days after being notified. 🎛️ The objection must be based on reasonable grounds (e.g. if the Controller proves that significant risks for the protection of its Personal Data exist at the subcontractor). If the Processor and the Controller are unable to resolve such objection, either party may terminate the Terms of Use by providing written notice to the other party. 🗃️ The provisions of this section also apply if the Processor uses a subcontractor in a third country. ⚜️ The Controller hereby authorizes the Processor, to agree in the name and on behalf of the Controller with a subcontractor which processes or uses the personal data of the Controller outside of the EEA, to enter into EU Standard Contractual Clauses for the Transfer of Personal Data to Processors Established in Third Countries dated 5 February 2010. This applies accordingly from the date of this authorization with respect to EU Standard Contractual Clauses (Processors) already concluded by the Processor with such subcontractors. 🔀

### 6. Duties to Inform

Where the Processor’s personal data becomes subject to search and seizure, an attachment order, confiscation during bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, or similar events or measures by third parties while being processed, the Processor shall inform the Controller without undue delay. 🧮 Processor shall, without undue delay, notify to all pertinent parties in such action, that any personal data affected is the Controller’s sole property and area of responsibility. In case of any conflict, the regulations of this DPA shall take precedence over the regulations of the Policies. 💢 Where individual regulations of this DPA are invalid or unenforceable, the validity and enforceability of the other regulations of this DPA shall not be affected. 😠 The Standard Contractual Clauses in SCHEDULE 1 will apply to the processing of Personal Data by Processor under the Policies. Upon the incorporation of this DPA into the Terms of Use, the parties are agreeing to the Standard Contractual Clauses in SCHEDULE 1 and all appendixes attached. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this DPA and the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail. The Standard Contractual Clauses apply only to personal data that is transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA) to outside the EEA, either directly or via onward transfer, to any country or recipient: (i) not recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data (as described in the EU Data Protection Directive), and (ii) not covered by a suitable framework recognized by the relevant authorities or courts as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data, including but not limited to binding corporate rules for processors.

### 7. Parties to this DPA

This DPA is an amendment to and forms part of the Privacy and Security Policy. The legal entity agreeing to this DPA as Controller represents that it is authorized to agree to and enter into this DPA for, and is agreeing to this DPA solely on behalf of, the Controller. 👩‍⚖️
